				On this website you are able to manage lists of characters with a lot of customization ability. To achieve that, you were
				just assigned a collection id. You can see it in the top right corner. If you ever want to change your browser or clear your
				locally saved data but also wish to keep your lists, make sure to save that id somewhere.

			<h3 class="py-2">
				A collection consists of one or more lists. Each of these lists consists of one or more characters and those consist of
				attributes and lists of subcharacters.
